# LoRA Washing Machine & Dryer Sensor
A small ESP8266 & RFM95W based sensor board that utilizes CT clamps to measuer your washing machine and dryers power consumption and report the reading via LoRa, e.g. to my [LoRa-To-MQTT-Gateway](https://github.com/ezcGman/lora-gateway)! Using LoRa enables you to also get reading froma washing machine hidden in the far end of a basement and report the readings multiple floors up to your apartment that hosts the LoRa gateway (and probably your Home Assistant).

## Credits
As for all my PCBs: Huge thanks to Quindor from QuinLED.info and also the folks from #pcb-design-talk on his Discord server! Would not have been able to do anything without these people!!

## KiCad dependencies
It might happen that KiCad is missing my custom footprints. You can find and download them here and then add them to KiCad: https://github.com/ezcGman/andys-footprints
